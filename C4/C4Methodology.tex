\section{Materials \& methods}

Solid state fermentation of \emph{A. oryzae} was carried out on either malt agar or the basal medium (BM) described in Section~\ref{sec:BasalMedium} supplemented with \gl{17.0} Agar No.~1 (Lab M, Lot Q28626/207), \gl{5} yeast extract (Oxoid, Lot 876584) and 2.0\% (w/v) soluble starch (BM\sb{S}) or glucose (BM\sb{G}). The media were adjusted to pH~7.0 (unless otherwise stated) prior to sterilisation. Immobilisation of fungal spores for solid culturing and the processing of solid-state-cultured membranes for image analysis was as described in Section~\ref{sec:OptAssay}.

Fungal micro-morphology was quantified using automated image analysis, as described in Section~\ref{sec:MicroAnalysis}. Semi-automatic image analysis was also performed to validate the automatic system. Noise removal was performed according to the automatic method. Grey-level thresholding and selection of hyphal elements from the image were both performed manually, as was artifact removal and the filling of any breaks or holes in the hyphal elements. The elements were then skeletonised and quantified according to the automatic method; the pruning of the skeleton was omitted from the semi-automatic method as artifact removal was performed prior to skeletonisation.
