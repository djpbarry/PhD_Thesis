Introduction: Why Fungi?
* Fungi traditionally associated with mould (as saprotrophs), infection, parasites:
o Associated with parasitic behaviour in plants, trees, insects, fish, animals and humans
o Destruction of crops, e.g. Irish potatoe famine, Bengali rice famine of 1942
* However, saprophytic mode of nutrition (as opposed to necrotrophic OR BIOTROPHIC) favourable for use in industry:
o Use of fungi in biodegradation as waste material.
o Fungi produce myco-diesel
o Various products obtained from microbial cultivation
o Saprophytic organisms – secrete metabolite into medium
o Host organisms for heterologous protein production – GRAS status important for this purpose
o History of industrial bioprocesses
o Wide range of compounds produced by fungi: enzymes, alcoholic beverages, mushrooms, mycoprotein, yeast biomass, cheese, industrial alcohol, acids, vitamins, antibiotics, biopharma, fungicides, insecticides, protein expression
o Waste product may be used as nutrient source
o Typical fermentor design
o Summary of process – benefits of SmF
o Solid culturing; miso, soy sauce, tempeh, koji in Japan
o Fungi as food
o Primary v secondary metabolites
o Genetic mutation and strain selection
* Background on Aspergillus oryzae

Fungal Growth
* Fungi commence and end life as spores – needed for dispersal, variety of factors influence germination
* Polarised hyphal growth, exponential branching
* Modelling of hyphal growth
* Sporulation results from nutrient limitations in some fungi, but generally poorly understood. Rare in submerged culture.
* Specific growth rates tend to be higher for filamentous growth (check pazouki).
* Perhipheral growth zone (pazouki).
* Coagulative versus non-coagulative pellet formation – influence of pH and agitation. Penicillium forms pellets via hyphal agglomeration
* Influences on pellet formation – inoculum concentration, pH, etc.
* Pellet growth restricted to ‘active laYER’ at pellet surface
* Hyphal development – history of findings


Significance of Morphology in Industrial Processes
* Different conditions for different metabolites
* Morphological variation
* Influences on morphology: inoculum level, initial pH, agitation, medium composition, and use of polymer additives or surface-active agents
* Agitation in STR
* Micromorphology versus macromorphology – 3D character
* Mathematical modelling
* Many different parameters used for morphological classification – few standards exist
* Morphology and productivity – cell physiology also a factor (grimm2005b)
* Colour image analysis?
* Cellular aggregation – branching and hyphal growth alone cannot explain morphology
* Variations in germination time
* Populations versus single mycelium
* Stress produced by fluid dynamic conditions influences mycelial disruption
* Indirect effects of morphology on productivity – influence of rheology, mixing, substrate gradients (tubular loop bioreactor), oxygen supply, power input
* Fragmentation; results in non-active tips; shear forces v hyphal tensile strength; lower osmotic pressure = more flexible hyphae; high Vacuolation = high fragmentation
* Filamentous form tends to grow on fermentor walls, impellet blades and shaft, block air inlets, etc.
* Cube root relationship
* Pellets also fragment – shearing of hyphae from surface = new growth centres
* Pellet shape depends on energy dissipation rate
* Problems with mixing associated with filamentous growth
* Problems with mass transfer associated with pelleted growth – critical pellet radius, autolysis
* 

Image Analysis as a tool for Morphological Quantification
* History of image analysis
* Reduce cost of PC’s makes image analysis available to most laboratories
* Other applications in industry
* Image analysis applied to microbial quantification
* Image analysis – sampling can be a challenge
* Hyphal width v mycelium width – automatic stage may used to ‘stich’ multiple photos together
* Image analysis of culture with suspended particles important – fungi used to treat industrial waste water
* Other methods of analysis other than image processing, e.g. FBRM, in-situ microscopy, etc.
* 

Fractals
* What are fractals?
* Fractal analysis of microbes


Thesis Overview

Papagianni Review:
* Growth inetics of germ tubes varies between organisms
* Hyphal diameter generally proportional to extension rate
* Exponential growth: conditions favourable for growth, nutrient excess, constant % of mass must contribute to new growth, branches form at rate proportionl to rate of increase in cell mass, branching frequency proportional to specific growth rate
* Trinci first reported that (1) thl increases exponentially (2) exponential increase in branches (3) specific rate equal to that in submerged culture
* Above is characterisitic of growth in young mycelium
* Radial extension rate/width of peripheral growth zone = specific growth rate
* Influences on pellet formation – changing one vriable often has indirect effect on others
* Cube root kinetics of pellet growth explained by Pirt as growth of active shell of outer mycelia
* Cell agingn; vacuolated hyphae torn off pellet surface and autolysis causes pellet disintegration
* Changes in hyphal wall composition with age
* Equation 16 – modelling of pellet size distribution
* Batch culture; adaptation, exponential growth, stationary phase
* Characterisation of morphology:
o Initially performed manually
o Digitising table
o Late 80’s – introduction of image analysis
o Extensive history of image analysis applied to microbes
o Modelling
o Little implementation of modelling data in industry
