\section{Materials \& methods}

Mycelial samples were produced by culturing membrane-immobilised \emph{A. oryzae} on malt agar and processing as described in Section~\ref{sec:OptAssay}. Microscopic images were subsequently acquired as described in Section~\ref{sec:microscopy}. Pellet samples were obtained by submerged culturing of \emph{A. oryzae} in basal medium (BM; see Section~\ref{sec:BasalMedium}) supplemented with 1.0\% (w/v) soluble starch (Sigma S-9765, Lot 93H0243 or Difco 0178-17-7, Lot FJ0041XA) and adjusted to pH~6.0. Erlenmeyer flasks (\ml{250}), with a working volume of 20\%, were incubated in a Lh Fermentation Mk X Incubator Shaker at \celc{30} and 200~rpm. Inoculum consisted of \ul{500} of \inoc{1}{7}. Images of pellet macro-morphology were acquired according to the method described in Section~\ref{sec:PelletScan}.
